Let’s break down the new cloud native orchestration layer, Kubernetes, into core computer science components and learn about them objectively. In this course you get an authentic, real-world guide on understanding what a container is – all the way to building out complex systems on top of Kubernetes. Walk away from this talk feeling like a cloud native expert ready to start running any application in Kubernetes.

Please note, this is an extended session. Part 1 begins at 2:15 pm. Part 2 begins at 3:15. Part 3 begins at 4:15.
