If in or near San Diego and interested in Kubernetes or CTO issues, come see me speak about it at https://www.0111conf.com , alongside amazing San Diego locals.

Would it surprise you to know that your operational team is experimenting with Kubernetes right now? Likely not. But what if I tell you your developers have also started to look beyond containers and into Kubernetes to improve productivity? Kubernetes isnâ€™t only helping organizations manage and scale production environments. It is also helping make developers more productive and the products they are building more robust. In this talk I am going to show you why.
